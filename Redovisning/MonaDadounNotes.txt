a good query suppose to have some correlation with my self, what am I searching for. If i just was searching for something i only remember words from it for Case 1: Searching for an article holding words "graduate" "programs" "mathemtics" then all the results listed are fair. 
Case 2: Searching for documents holding graduate programs and some mathematics, then a better query would be using phrase query with only graduate program. and the search for mathematics. i.e. using biword
Case 3: I really want to find all documents that only hold the query words then this could result in some hits, maybe none.

svårt att sätta relevanse, att vi får tre ord utan kontext och måste själva hitta på en kontext jag tolkade det som att man vil veta mer och ett graduate program inom matematik.
